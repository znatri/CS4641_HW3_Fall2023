        You have to plot two different scatterplots (2d and 3d) for this function. For plotting the 2d scatterplot, use your PCA implementation to reduce the dataset to only 2 features. You'll need to run PCA on the dataset and then transform it so that the new dataset only has 2 features.
        Create a scatter plot of the reduced data set and differentiate points that have different true labels using color using plotly.
        Hint: Refer to https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/ for making scatter plots with plotly.
        Hint: We recommend converting the data into a pandas dataframe before plotting it. Refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html for more details.
